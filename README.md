Introduction:
This is Mini Project 1 ("Classical Encryption"), written by Madel Sibal.

Description:
The following submission contains two different programs: CaesarCipher.java
and VigenereCipher.java. The CaesarCipher program encodes or decodes a string 
given by the user. On the other hand, the VigenereCipher program encodes or
decodes a string given by the user using a keyword (also given by the user)
to shift the text.

Resources:
Oracle Help Center was used in order to figure out basic Java syntax and 
techniques. In specific, I used the String Method and Constructor
Summary from the Oracle Help Center to help me figure out basic
Java syntax, including functions like s.charAt(n) and s.length(n).
I did not console with other people, mentors, or professors to figure out
this project.
