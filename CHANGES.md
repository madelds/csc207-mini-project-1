The following changes were made to my Mini Project 1 
submission in terms of my first revision:

1: I updated the README.md file to include an in-depth
description of the contents of my Mini Project 1
submission. I also added a detailed description of
who I worked with during this project and what exact
resources I used.

2: I added introductory comments for each of my classes.

3: In CaesarCipher.java, I added a condition that handles
the case when the input string is empty.
